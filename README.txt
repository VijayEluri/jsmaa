README for JSMAA
================
JSMAA implements Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) methodology.
Currently is implemented:
-SMAA-2 for utility-theory based decision analysis (ranking / choosing problem statement).
-SMAA-TRI for outranking based sorting problems.
-SMAA-O for ordinal criteria measurements (part of SMAA-2-model).

Versions
========
0.6.3:	Added showing of scales to preference information view. Major refactors and small fixes.
0.6.2:	Add exporting of GNUPlot scripts for figures. Fix SMAA-2 simulation crash on adding criterion.
0.6.1:	Fix major bug in previous versions of not updating output graphs/tables when they are showing.
0.6:	XML model files, ordinal criteria, improved output tables, reordering of alternatives/criteria/categories,
	improved tooltips, and various minor improvements.
0.4.1:	Improvements of the GUI usability and bug fixes. 
0.4:	Adds SMAA-TRI, uncertainty individually for measurements, cardinal preference information, graph output,
	and various minor improvements.
0.2:	Initial release implementing SMAA-2.
